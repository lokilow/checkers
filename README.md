# Checkers

All rendering done server side

Inspired by [Chris McCord's keynote at
ElixirConf2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2DU0qLfPIY)

I don't expect the performance to be nearly as good as the coming LiveView for Phoenix


## To run
You must have racket installed.

```
git clone https://github.com/lokilow/checkers.git
